# MOGA
A new multipopulation-based multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is proposed, which uses a unique cross-subpopulation migration process inspired by biological processes to share information between subpopulations. Then, a Markov model of the proposed multipopulation MOGA is derived, the first of its kind, which provides an exact mathematical model for each possible population occurring simultaneously with multiple objectives. 

A MATLAB toolbox for implementing MOGA has been included in this folder. If you find MOGA useful in your research, please cite our paper in your publications:
